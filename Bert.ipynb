Traditionally, municipalities, like other territorial units, are characterized by a series of social and economic indicators that determine their degree of local development. The objective of this article is to identify and assess, through a system of indicators, what role urban and rural municipalities in Andalusia (Spain) play in the provision and reception of ecosystem services. To this end, Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques are used and a cluster analysis is carried out to contrast the results.\n",

Different physicochemical and biochemical parameters such as O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation, Hydrophobicity, GRAVY were identified within epitopic regions of S-protein.

The capability of two tetanus-specific mAbs, namely mAb and mAb, to prevent chlamydial infection has been assessed: (i) in vitro, by performing a neutralization assay using human conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cells infected with Chlamydia trachomatis serovar B, and (ii) in vivo, by using a guinea pig model of Chlamydia caviae-induced inclusion conjunctivitis. The mAb has been superior in comparison with mAb in the prevention of chlamydial infection in HCjE cells. The mAb has conferred ≈% inhibition of the infection, compared to less than % inhibition in the presence of the mAb. In vivo, mAb significantly diminished ocular pathology intensity in guinea pigs infected with C. caviae compared to either the mAb-treated or sham-treated guinea pigs.

The most important public health intervention for such pathogens is therefore to suppress transmission as much as possible. The current COVID- pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV- coronavirus, provides a stark example. Wide-scale shifts in human social networks, from restrictions on travel to lockdowns of entire cities or countries, have been critical to the success of slowing the pandemic and reducing the number of deaths.\n",

Examples where some evidence exists for adaptation following host shifts include myxoma virus in rabbits, and avian flu, Ebola, and Zika virus in humans []. With SARS-CoV-, we might also expect further adaptation to its human host.

In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV- genome to identify miRNA-like hairpins and searched for potential miRNAbased interactions between the viral miRNAs and human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Our PANTHER gene function analysis results indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator, STAT and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition, many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes.

Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of -nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of -nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc . and validated by N-GlyDE server.

The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version . based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein.

Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in -nCoV. In addition, antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins. In spite of the variation in S protein amino acid composition, we found no significant difference in their structures.

The guidance document provides an introduction to epidemiological studies and illustrates the typical biases of the different epidemiological study designs. It describes key epidemiological concepts relevant for evidence appraisal. Regarding study reliability, measures of association, exposure assessment, statistical inferences, systematic error and effect modification are explained. Regarding study relevance, the guidance describes the concept of external validity. The principles of appraising epidemiological studies are illustrated, and an overview of Risk of Bias (RoB) tools is given. A decision tree is developed to assist in the selection of the appropriate Risk of Bias tool, depending on study question, population and design. The customisation of the study appraisal process is explained, detailing the use of RoB tools and assessing the risk of bias in the body of evidence. Several examples of appraising experimental and observational studies using a Risk of Bias tool are annexed to the document to illustrate the application of the approach. This document constitutes a draft that will be applied in EFSA's assessments during a -year pilot phase and be revised and complemented as necessary. Before finalisation of the document, a public consultation will be launched. \n",

            "As the world continues to deal with climate-induced heat events, sustainable energy behaviours, or lifestyles combined with non-behavioural interventions have been identified as crucial pathways to curb the demand for air conditioners. Typically, ecological communities serve as a reference point for sustainable lifestyles as they have strong environmental self-identity and values and are more likely to further engage in pro-environmental and energy-saving actions. Yet, it is unknown if individuals within these communities will act as expected, especially when confronted with extreme climatic challenges like heatwaves. It is also unclear which factors will define individual responses to these challenges. Utilising environmental self-identity and Value-Belief-Norm theories, this paper examines factors underlying cooling consumption behaviours of households living in a Universal Community with strong environmental world views in India. Twenty in-depth qualitative interviews with residents, thematically analysed, found that while people expressed strong environmental self-identity, preferences for air conditioner use was often mediated by hedonic factors such as comfort and sleep. Moral norms played a positive role in how people operated their air conditioners. Yet, when faced with the choice of using energy-efficient air conditioners, biospheric concern was of limited importance while situational factors like cost and functionality were more pivotal. The above results raise interesting questions around the difficulties that might emerge in changing preferences around air conditioning behaviours in non-environmental communities, especially, if environmentally conscious communities which are expected to be \"the locus of change for energy efficiency actions\" are significantly influenced by hedonic values. \n",

Research on these topics would enhance our knowledge of this virus and help us develop vaccines or predict its paths of mutations. There are many theoretical and clinical researches in this area. In this article, we devise a structural metric which directly measures the structural differences between any two nucleotide sequences. In order to explore the mechanisms of how the evolution works, we associate the nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV- and its related families with the degrees of randomness. Since the distances between randomly generated nucleotide sequences are very concentrated around a mean with low variance, they are qualified as good candidates for the fundamental reference. Such reference could then be applied to measure the randomness of other Coronaviridae sequences. Our findings show that the relative randomness ratios are very consistent and concentrated. This result indicates their randomness is very stable and predictable. The findings also reveal the evolutional behaviours between the Coronaviridae and all its subfamilies. \n",

            " pathogens into novel host species have a long history in biomedical research. This provides a rich  and largely unexploited data source for meta-analyses to identify the host and pathogen  determinants of variability in infection outcomes. Here, we analysed the progressions of   experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, a widespread zoonotic pathogen which in  nature exhibits both dead end infections and varying levels of sustained transmission in novel hosts.  Inoculations originating from bats rather than carnivores, and from warmer to cooler-bodied  species caused infections with shorter incubation periods that were associated with diminished  virus excretion. Inoculations between distantly related hosts tended to result in shorter clinical  disease periods, which will also impede transmission. All effects were modulated by infection dose  and together suggest that increased virulence as host species become more dissimilar is the limiting  factor preventing onward transmission. These results explain observed constraints on rabies virus  host shifts, allow us to evaluate the risk of novel reservoirs establishing, and give mechanistic  insights into why host shifts are less likely between genetically distant species. More generally, our  study highlights meta-analyses of experimental infections as a tractable approach to quantify the  complex interactions between virus, reservoir, and novel host that shape the outcome of cross- species transmission. \n",
            " Emerging disease epidemics often result from a pathogen establishing transmission in a novel host  species. However, most cross-species transmissions fail to establish in the newly infected species  for reasons that remain poorly understood. Examining cross-species inoculations involving rabies,  a widespread viral zoonosis, we show that mismatches in virulence, which are predictable from  host and viral factors, make sustained transmission in the novel host less likely. In particular,  disease progression was accelerated and virus excretion decreased when the reservoir and novel  host were physiologically or genetically more dissimilar. These mechanistic insights help to  explain and predict host shift events and highlight meta-analyses of existing experimental  inoculation data as a powerful and generalisable approach for understanding the dynamics of index  infections in novel species.  Ogbu et al., ). Cross-species transmission is also the first step towards host shifts, where  pathogens establish transmission cycles in novel hosts (Wolfe et al., ). While the broader-scale  epidemiological and ecological factors driving cross-species transmission are beginning to be  understood (reviewed in Lloyd-Smith et al., ; Plowright et al., , ), we remain unable  to anticipate whether cross-species transmission will cause 'dead-end' infections or lead to  sustained transmission. Infection dynamics at the cross-species interface, specifically the  probability of infection given exposure and the progression of index infections in novel hosts, are  generally unobservable in nature. This is a crucial gap given that the outcomes of cross-species  infections have profound implications for host shifts and disease emergence. \n",
            " Cross-infection studies, in which viruses from a natural reservoir are experimentally inoculated  into novel host species, provide a rare view into the dynamics of index infections. Since the dose,  route, timing and origin of viral exposure are known, these factors can be controlled for to identify  the ecological and evolutionary rules that govern the outcomes of cross-species transmission. We  focus on Rabies lyssavirus (family Rhabdoviridae) as a model pathogen for understanding cross- species transmission (Fisher et al., ). Rabies virus is a zoonotic RNA virus, transmitted through  an infectious bite, that infects all mammals and, untreated, has the highest case fatality ratio of any  infectious disease (Hemachudha et al., ; Rupprecht et al., ) . Rabies virus naturally infects  multiple carnivore and bat species, which each perpetuate species-specific maintenance cycles  (Mollentze et al., ) . Although most cross-species transmission events do not lead to onward  transmission, each maintenance cycle represents a rare past cross-species transmission event that  established transmission in a novel host. Dead-end cross-species transmissions and historical host  shifts are detectable in rabies virus phylogenies, and epidemiological surveillance reveals that  nascent hosts shifts remain commonplace (Kuzmin et al., ; Mollentze et al., ; Streicker et  al., ). As such, rabies virus exhibits extensive variation in the epidemiological outcomes of  cross-species transmission. Here, we exploit cross-infection studies conducted over several  decades, in which diverse mammalian species were inoculated with rabies viruses of bat and \n",

            "Purpose of Review This investigation aims to understand the role and burden of viral co-infections for acute respiratory illnesses in children. Co-infection can be either viral-viral or viral-bacterial and with new technology there is more information on the role they play on the health of children. Recent Findings With the proliferation of multiplex PCR for rapid diagnosis of multiple viruses as well as innovations on identification of bacterial infections, research has been attempting to discover how these co-infections affect each other and the host. Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level. Studies are also attempting to discover the burden of morbidity and mortality of these viral-viral co-infections on the pediatric population. It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. Summary RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space. Future research needs to focus on confirming these conclusions as it could affect hospital cohorting, role of molecular testing, and therapeutic interventions. \n",

            "Viruses use cell machinery to replicate their genome and produce viral proteins. For this reason, several intracellular factors, including the redox state, might directly or indirectly affect the progression and outcome of viral infection. In physiological conditions, the redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant species is maintained by enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems, and it finely regulates several cell functions. Different viruses break this equilibrium and induce an oxidative stress that in turn facilitates specific steps of the virus lifecycle and activates an inflammatory response. In this context, many studies highlighted the importance of redox-sensitive pathways as novel cell-based targets for therapies aimed at blocking both viral replication and virus-induced inflammation. In the review, we discuss the most recent findings in this field. In particular, we describe the effects of natural or synthetic redox-modulating molecules in inhibiting DNA or RNA virus replication as well as inflammatory pathways. The importance of the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf is also discussed. Most of the data reported here are on influenza virus infection. We believe that this approach could be usefully applied to fight other acute respiratory viral infections characterized by a strong inflammatory response, like COVID-. \n",

            "Vaccines are one of the most powerful technologies supporting public health. The adaptive immune response induced by immunization arises following appropriate activation and differentiation of T and B cells in lymph nodes. Among many parameters impacting the resulting immune response, the presence of antigen and inflammatory cues for an appropriate temporal duration within the lymph nodes, and further within appropriate subcompartments of the lymph nodes-the right timing and location-play a critical role in shaping cellular and humoral immunity. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of how vaccine kinetics and biodistribution impact adaptive immunity, and the underlying immunological mechanisms that govern these responses. We discuss emerging approaches to engineer these properties for future vaccines, with a focus on subunit vaccines. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof T cell responses generated naturally in infected humans are used to guide the selection of appropriate antigens to re-elicit this response through vaccination [] [] [] .

            " Within lymph nodes, T cells and B cells are compartmentalized into specific sites, with T cells residing primarily in the paracortex deeper in the lymph nodes while B cells reside in follicles (Fig. ) . Vaccine particles carried to the lymph node by lymph or in lymph-migrating APCs arrive at the subcapsular sinus of the draining lymph node. The sinus is lined by a layer of macrophages and epithelial cells that form a barrier limiting access to the LN parenchyma. Material in the sinus can either drain to the medullary sinuses and subsequently exit the node through efferent lymphatics, which travel to the next lymph node in the chain, be passed into the LN parenchyma via gated, narrow collagen conduits [] [] [] [] , or be physically captured and transferred across the sinus barrier by sinus-lining macrophages [, ] .\n",
            " Transport within the lymph node impacts access of antigen/adjuvant compounds to key cells moderating lymphocyte activation: dendritic cells that specialize in priming CD + helper vs. CD + cytolytic T cells are localized in distinct sites, with CD-priming DCs located deeper in the paracortex [, ] . B cells that receive initial signaling by binding to cognate antigens enter specialized subregions of the follicles termed germinal centers (GCs), which are split into a light zone and a dark zone. Follicular dendritic cells in the light zone capture and retain antigen via Fc and complement receptors, which they can present for prolonged periods to local B cells [, ] . Within the GC, B cells undergo the cyclic process of affinity maturation: In the dark zone, B cells proliferate and mutate their antigen receptors; as a round of proliferation ends, GC B cells migrate to the light zone, where they can acquire antigen from FDCs that is processed and presented on class II MHC to follicular helper T cells (Tfh). Tfh cells play a crucial role in providing survival and costimulatory cues to B cells that determine the amount of proliferation and antigen receptor mutation they carry out on returning to the dark zone, and competition among B cell clones for Tfh help determines the outcome of the GC response [] [] [] . B cells which fail to receive sufficient signals from Tfh undergo apoptosis [] . B cells can exit the GC to become short-lived antibody producing cells termed plasmablasts, long-lived antibodyproducing plasma cells, or memory cells; the cues governing these fate decisions remain poorly understood. B cell-Tfh interactions are ultimately governed by the antigen acquired by the GC B cell [] , and the amount of antigen accumulated in lymph nodes directly correlates with the number of Tfh and GC B cells that develop in immunized lymph nodes [] . Thus, the efficiency of antigen delivery to FDCs will also affect responses to immunization.\n",

            " A classic fundamental function of vaccine adjuvants has been thought to be the promotion of cell-mediated trafficking of antigen to draining lymph nodes. In general, this mode of vaccine delivery is promoted by attracting migratory immune cells to the injection site from the local tissue or the blood, which can internalize antigen and subsequently migrate to the draining lymphatic vessels to carry vaccine components to the draining LN (Fig. , pathway ) . Two licensed adjuvants, alum ( Fig. A) and MF (Fig. B , an oil-in-water nanoemulsion), are thought to promote vaccine responses in large part through such mechanisms [] . Both alum and MF induce the local production of chemokines recruiting neutrophils, monocytes, DCs, and macrophages to the injection site [, , ] . These recruited cells subsequently take up antigen and transport it to draining lymph nodes, increasing the amount of antigen + cells compared to antigen alone and triggering activation of APCs in the dLNs [, ] .

We investigated whether monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for tetanus could cross-react with Chlamydia and confer heterologous protection against chlamydial infection. The capability of two tetanus-specific mAbs, namely mAb and mAb, to prevent chlamydial infection has been assessed: (i) in vitro, by performing a neutralization assay using human conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cells infected with Chlamydia trachomatis serovar B, and (ii) in vivo, by using a guinea pig model of Chlamydia caviae-induced inclusion conjunctivitis. The mAb has been superior in comparison with mAb in the prevention of chlamydial infection in HCjE cells. The mAb has conferred ≈% inhibition of the infection, compared to less than % inhibition in the presence of the mAb. In vivo, mAb significantly diminished ocular pathology intensity in guinea pigs infected with C. caviae compared to either the mAb-treated or sham-treated guinea pigs. Our data provide insights that tetanus immunization generates antibodies which induce heterologous chlamydial immunity and promote protection beyond the intended target pathogen. \n",

In this paper, a detailed comparison is given of the behavior of continuous and discrete models for two representative time-delay models, namely a model for HIV and an extended logistic growth model. For each model, there are seven different time-delay versions because there are seven different positions to include time delays. For the seven different time-delay versions of each model, proofs are given of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov-Hopf bifurcations in the differential equations and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations in the difference equations. We show that only five of the seven time-delay versions have bifurcations and that all bifurcation versions have supercritical limit cycles with one having a repelling cycle and four having attracting cycles. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the analytical results and to show that critical times for Neimark-Sacker bifurcations are less than critical times for Andronov-Hopf bifurcations but converge to them as the time step of the discretization tends to zero.

Neutralizing antibodies against N- terminal domain could be found in COVID- patients [-], and may neutralize virus  infection for several reasons. First, Chi et al postulated that the antibody may prevent the  conformational change of the S protein which is necessary for fusion []. Second, antibody  against N-terminal domain may block the spike protein that binds to an unidentified receptor.  The N-terminal domain of S subunit has been shown to participate in binding for other  coronaviruses. The human coronaviruses OC and HKU has been shown to bind to -O- acetylated sialic acids, while MERS-CoV- binds to non-acetylated sialic acid, via the N- terminal domain [,]. The mouse hepatitis virus binds to host cell receptor carcinoembryonic  antigen-related cell adhesion molecule via the S N-terminal domain [].

Mutations at spike protein amino acid residue  are  rarely found, accounting for <.% of the strains deposited in GISAID as of September ,  . The low prevalence of WL mutation suggest that this mutation may confer reduced  fitness or transmissibility. However, since usually only one viral sequence from each patient  would be deposited into public databases, the prevalence of WL mutation may have been  underestimated.

We report a facile methodology for rapid epitope mapping of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against HIV- Envelope (Env) at single residue resolution, using Cys labeling, viral neutralization assays and deep sequencing. This was achieved by the generation of a library of Cys mutations in Env glycoprotein on the viral surface, covalent labeling of the Cys residues using a Cys reactive label that masks epitope residues, followed by infection of the labeled mutant virions in mammalian cells in the presence of NAbs. Env gene sequencing from NAb-resistant viruses was used to accurately delineate epitopes for the NAbs VRC, PGT and PGT. These agreed well with corresponding experimentally determined structural epitopes previously inferred from NAb:Env structures. HIV- infection is associated with complex and polyclonal antibody responses, typically composed of multiple antibody specificities. Deconvoluting the epitope specificities in a polyclonal response is a challenging task. We therefore extended our methodology to map multiple specificities of epitopes targeted in polyclonal sera, elicited in immunized animals as well as in an HIV- infected elite neutralizer capable of neutralizing Tier- pseudoviruses with high titers. The method can be readily extended to other viruses for which convenient reverse genetics or lentiviral surface display systems are available. \n",

The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites mutated across all strains and individual samples of the SARS-Cov- genome; given the high cost and limited availability of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, especially in early stages of infections when only a small number of genomic samples (∼ s) are available that do not allow for determining the exact degree of mutations in an RNA virus that comprises roughly ,  nucleotides. Nevertheless, working with small sample sets is required in order to quickly predict the mutation rate of this and other viruses and get an insight into their transformational power. Furthermore, with the small number of samples available, it is hard to estimate the mutational landscape across different age/gender groups and geographical locations which may be of great importance in assessing different risk categories and factors influencing susceptibility to infection. To this end, we use our state-of-the art polynomial estimator techniques and the Good-Turing estimator to obtain estimates based on only roughly ,  samples per category. Our analysis reveals an interesting finding: the mutational support appears to be statistically more significant in patients which appear to have lower infection rates and handle the exposure with milder symptoms, such as women and people of relatively young age (≤ ). \n",

            "Purpose To reveal that a computed tomography surveillance program (CT-surveillance) could demonstrate the epidemiologic features of COVID- infection and simultaneously investigate the type and frequency of CT findings using clinical CT data. Materials and methods We targeted individuals with possible CT findings of viral pneumonia. Using an online questionnaire, we asked Japanese board-certified radiologists to register their patients' information including patient age and sex, the CT examination date, the results of PCR test for COVID- infection, CT findings, and the postal code of the medical institution that performed the CT. We compared the diurnal patient number and the cumulative regional distribution map of registrations in CT-surveillance to those of the PCR-positive patient surveillance (PCR-surveillance). Results A total of  patients was registered from January  to April ,  for CT-surveillance. Their PCR test results were positive (n = .-%), negative (n = .-%), unknown (n = .-%), and other disease (n = .-%). An age peak at - years and male dominance were observed in CT-surveillance. The most common CT finding was bilaterally distributed ground-glass opacities. The diurnal number and the cumulative regional distribution map by CT-surveillance showed tendencies that were similar to those revealed by PCR-surveillance. Conclusion Using clinical CT data, CT-surveillance program delineated the epidemiologic features of COVID- infection. \n",

            "Screening and diagnostic tests are used to classify people with and without a disease. Diagnostic accuracy measures are used to evaluate the correctness of a classification in clinical research and practice. Although this depends on the uncertainty of measurement, there has been limited research on their relation. The objective of this work was to develop an exploratory tool for the relation between diagnostic accuracy measures and measurement uncertainty, as diagnostic accuracy is fundamental to clinical decision-making, while measurement uncertainty is critical to quality and risk management in laboratory medicine. For this reason, a freely available interactive program was developed for calculating, optimizing, plotting and comparing various diagnostic accuracy measures and the corresponding risk of diagnostic or screening tests measuring a normally distributed measurand, applied at a single point in time in non-diseased and diseased populations. This is done for differing prevalence of the disease, mean and standard deviation of the measurand, diagnostic threshold, standard measurement uncertainty of the tests and expected loss. The application of the program is illustrated with a case study of glucose measurements in diabetic and non-diabetic populations. The program is user-friendly and can be used as an educational and research tool in medical decision-making. \n",

            "Early detection surveillance is used for various purposes, including the early detection of non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer screening), of unusual increases of disease frequency (e.g. influenza or pertussis outbreaks), and the first occurrence of a disease in a previously free population. This latter purpose is particularly important due to the high consequences and cost of delayed detection of a disease moving to a new population.\n",
            " Quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance allows important aspects of the performance of different systems, approaches and authorities to be evaluated, compared and improved. While quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity of other branches of surveillance has been available for many years, development has lagged in the area of early detection, arguably one of the most important purposes of surveillance. This paper, using mostly animal health examples, develops a simple approach to quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance, in terms of population coverage, temporal coverage and detection sensitivity. This approach is extended to quantify the benefits of risk-based approaches to early detection surveillance. Population-based clinical surveillance (based on either farmers and their veterinarians, or patients and their local health services) provides the best combination of sensitivity, practicality and cost-effectiveness. These systems can be significantly enhanced by removing disincentives to reporting, for instance by implementing effective strategies to improve farmer awareness and engagement with health services and addressing the challenges of well-intentioned disease notification policies that inadvertently impose barriers to reporting.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: While institution-sponsored wellness programs may be effective, little is known about their availability and utilization in pediatric subspecialists, and about programs physicians wish were available. METHODS: A survey of perceptions about, and availability and utilization of institutional wellness activities, was distributed electronically to pediatric subspecialists nationally. Bivariate analyses were performed using χ  tests or independent t tests. Multivariable logistic regression models for categories of institution-sponsored programming as a function of potential predictors of program utilization were performed. Qualitative content analysis was performed for free-text survey answers. RESULTS: Approximately % of respondents participated in institution-sponsored wellness opportunities. Debriefs, Schwartz Center Rounds, mental health services, and team building events were the most available institution-sponsored wellness activities, whereas debriefs, team building, Schwartz Center Rounds, and pet therapy were most frequently utilized. Respondents desired greater social/emotional support, improved leadership, enhanced organizational support, and modifications to the physical work environment, with no significant differences across subspecialties for \"wish list\" items. CONCLUSIONS: Physician wellness requires more than a \"one-size-fits-all\" initiative. Our data highlight the importance of encouraging and normalizing self-care practices, and of listening to what physicians articulate about their needs. Preimplementation needs assessment allows a \"bottom-up\" approach where physician voices can be heard. \n",

We explore how, in principle, ICR can come about and what conditions might be effective in promoting more ethical behaviour. We propose a framework to understand attempts to develop more responsible behaviour at an industry level through processes of negotiation and coalition building. We suggest that any attempt to meaningfully influence ICR would require stakeholders to possess both power and legitimacy; moreover, magnitude and urgency of the issue at stake may affect the ability to influence ICR. The framework is applied to the retail banking industry, focusing on post-crisis experiences in two countries-Spain and the UK-where there has been considerable pressure on the retail banking industry by civil society and/or government to change behaviours, especially to abandon unethical practices. We illustrate in this paper how corporate responsibility at the sector level in retail banking is the product of context-specific processes of negotiation between civil society and public authorities, on behalf of customers and other stakeholders, drawing on legal and other institutions to influence industry behaviour.\n",

This is a challenging question given that the traditional reservoirs of convenience (like metaphysical universalism) are no longer at our disposal the way they used to be. The paper is divided into eight sections: () It is specified what challenges a non-foundationalist justification and normativity has to meet. () A three-dimensional conception of responsibility is developed based on the human triangular I-We-World relations. () The concepts of bounded responsibility and bounded ethics of science and technology are formulated. () The principle of reflective equilibrium is introduced as a principle of rationality, and it is shown how this principle generates rational and reasonable justifications in the ethics of science and technology. () Against this background, a reconception of internal and external responsibilities of science is given. () The type of responsibility demanded is exemplified by today's climate research. () The paper argues for a hand-in-hand model of uncertainties in the sciences and for ethical obligations to preserve the conditions of human life on earth. The ethical argument is spelled out in terms of ethical care, preservation, and precaution. () Additionally, some arguments are developed to answer the question of why it is reasonable at all to preserve human life on earth. \n",

In vivo, mAb significantly diminished ocular pathology intensity in guinea pigs infected with C. caviae compared to either the mAb-treated or sham-treated guinea pigs.

Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or the S region of the spike (MVA/S) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA/S or MVA/S, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV- spike protein. The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S and S whereas MVA/S induced an antibody response to the S region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA/S but not MVA/S vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV- that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers. Mechanistically, S binding to ACE- was strong but reduced following prolonged pre-incubation at room temperature suggesting confirmation changes in RBD with time. These results demonstrate MVA/S is a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV- infection. \n",

In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression.

            "In this study, which aims at early diagnosis of Covid- disease using X-ray images, the deep-learning approach, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence method, was used, and automatic classification of images was performed using convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the first training-test data set used in the study, there were  X-ray images, of which  were Covid- and  were non-Covid-, while in the second training-test data set there were  X-ray images, of which  were Covid- and  were non-Covid-. Thus, classification results have been provided for two data sets, containing predominantly Covid- images and predominantly non-Covid- images, respectively. In the study, a -layer CNN architecture and a -layer CNN architecture were developed. Within the scope of the study, the results were obtained using chest X-ray images directly in the training-test procedures and the sub-band images obtained by applying dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to the above-mentioned images. The same experiments were repeated using images obtained by applying local binary pattern (LBP) to the chest X-ray images. Within the scope of the study, four new result generation pipeline algorithms having been put forward additionally, it was ensured that the experimental results were combined and the success of the study was improved. In the experiments carried out in this study, the training sessions were carried out using the k-fold cross validation method. Here the k value was chosen as  for the first and second training-test data sets. Considering the average highest results of the experiments performed within the scope of the study, the values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F- score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the first training-test data set were ,, ,, ,, , and , respectively; while for the second training-test data set, they were ,, ,, ,, , and ,; respectively. Within the scope of the study, finally, all the images were combined and the training and testing processes were repeated for a total of  X-ray images comprising  Covid- images and  non-Covid- images, by applying -fold cross.

            "Under the global pandemic of COVID-, the use of artificial intelligence to analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID- diagnosis and patient triage is becoming important. Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID- pandemic, a systematic collection of CXR data set for deep neural network training is difficult. To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters for COVID- diagnosis. The proposed method is inspired by our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR radiographs. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency maps, which are useful for COVID- diagnosis and patient triage. \n",

Methods: Data from a -wk, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase  trial (NCT) and an open-label extension (OLE) trial ≤ wk (NCT) were analyzed. Participants received solriamfetol . (-week study only), , , or  mg/day or placebo (week study only). Inclusion required current/prior primary OSA therapy use, including positive airway pressure (PAP), oral appliance, or surgical intervention. Primary OSA therapy use was recorded throughout the studies as electronically downloadable data (when available) or by diary. Baseline (BL) and end-of-study data are summarized for the safety populations. OLE data are reported for participants with OSA directly enrolled from a previous study; BL refers to BL in the parent study. Adverse events (AEs) are summarized.

            " Objectives: Sleep is a complex physiological process regulated by various brain circuits and neurotransmitter systems. Empirical research has clearly demonstrated that different aspects of sleep health are related to future morbidity and mortality. However, it is unclear whether neurostructural abnormalities underlie different aspects of sleep health. Several small-scale cross-sectional case-control studies have supported this hypothesis; however, the results so far are somewhat inconclusive. Thus, in light of recent doubts about replicability and low power in neuroimaging studies, the current study seeks to investigate the independent associations between several sleep health variables and brain morphometry in a large sample of individuals of the UK Biobank (UKBB, current results are based on a sample of n = ,; results presented in Sevilla will be based on an updated sample of n = ,). Methods: Cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank (Sudlow et al., ) was analyzed using multiple linear regression models with sleep health variables (insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness and chronotype) as concurrently included independent variables. Covariates Fragestellung: Bei Patienten mit mangelhafter Nutzung einer positiven Atemwegsdruck-Therapie (PAP) wird ein Maskenwechsel häufig in der klinischen Routine eingesetzt. Ziel der vorliegenden Analyse ist es daher, die Auswirkungen eines Maskenwechsels auf die PAP-Nutzung zu evaluieren. Patienten und Methoden: Die Daten eines deutschen Gesundheitsdienstleisters (ResMed Healthcare Germany) wurden retrospectiv analysiert. Patienten, die zwischen April  und Juli  mit der PAP-Therapie begonnen und erstmals ihren Maskentyp oder ihr Modell (Maskenverschiebung) gewechselt haben, wurden in die Analyse eingeschlossen (n = .; erster Maskentyp: nasal- %, Nasenpolster  % und oronasal  %). Ergebnisse: Bei Patienten mit niedriger PAP-Nutzung (≤ h/Tag,  %) war ein Wechsel der Maske mit einem stärkeren Anstieg der PAP-Adhärenz im Vergleich zu Patienten mit ausreichender PAP-Adhärenz (> h/ Tag,  %: ∆ ±  versus ∆- ±  min/Tag, p < ,) assoziiert.  % der Patienten mit niedriger PAP-Nutzung erreichten nach Wechsel der Maske eine ausreichende PAP-Nutzung. Der Wechsel von Nasenmaske zu einem anderen Maskentyp oder -modell (multiple binäre logistische Regressionsanalyse; OR [ % CI]: , [,; ,]) sowie früher (< Tage nach Einleitung der PAP-Therapie; , [,; ,]) oder später Wechsel des Maskentyps (> Tage; ,[,; ,]) waren signifikant mit dem Erreichen einer PAP-Nutzung > h/Tag assoziiert. Alter, Versicherungsstatus, Art des PAP-Gerätyps, Leckage und Rest-AHI zeigten keinen relevanten Zusammenhang mit dem Erreichen einer PAP-Nutzung > h/Tag. Schlussfolgerungen: Bei  % der Patienten mit niedriger PAP-Nutzung kommt es nach Maskenwechsel noch zu einer ausreichenden PAP-Adhärenz von > h/Tag. Der Wechsel von einer Nasenmaske zu einem anderen Masken-Typ oder Modell sowie ein Wechsel der Maske < Monate und > Jahr nach Einleitung der PAP-Therapie sind unabhängige Prädiktoren für das Erreichen einer ausreichenden PAP-Adhärenz.

No other sleep health variables were related to brain morphometry.\n",
            " The current results suggest a negative association between subjective short sleep duration and grey matter volume in the right precuneus-and a positive association between subjective short sleep duration and grey matter volume of the th lobule of the cerebellar vermis. The former finding might be related to altered DMN connectivity in patients with short sleep duration. However, further sleep health variables like insomnia symptoms and daytime sleepiness were not associated with changes in brain morphometry. Fragestellung: Epidemiologische Studien weisen darauf hin, dass Schlafdauer und -qualität mit der Entstehung von Übergewicht zusammenhängen könnten (z. B. Taheri et al., ). Die Verteilung des Köperfetts wurde bis jetzt nur von wenigen Studien berücksichtigt. Ziel dieser Studie ist es, den Zusammenhang von Schlafparametern und der Körperzusammensetzung bei Patienten mit Insomnie zu untersuchen. Patienten und Methoden: Eingeschlossen wurden neun Insomniepatientinnen (Alter:  ±  Jahre, BMI: , ± , kg/m  ). Die Untersuchungen im Rahmen der Studie umfassten zwei Nächte Polysomnographie, die Messung der Fettmasse und der fettfreien Masse mittels Air Displacement Plethysmography, sowie eine Messung des subkutanen und viszeralen Fettanteils mittels abdominaler Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT). Ergebnisse: Die durchschnittliche Schlafdauer betrug  ±  min, die REM-Schlafdauer  ±  min und die Schlafeffizienz  ±  %. Die Fettmasse lag bei , ± , kg und die fettfreie Masse bei , ± , kg. Die MRT-Untersuchung ergab einen viszeralen Fettanteil von , ± , Litern und einen subkutanen Fettanteil von , ± , Litern. Das Hauptergebnis war eine signifikante negative Partialkorrelation (Kontrolliert für Alter) der subkutanen (r = -,) und viszeralen Fettmasse (r = -,) mit der REM-Schlafdauer, nicht aber mit nonREM-Schlaf Parametern. Schlussfolgerungen: Diese Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass vor allem die REM-Schlafdauer bei der Entwicklung von Übergewicht bei Insomnie eine Rolle spielen könnte. Obwohl diese Studie keine Aussage zur Kausalität erlaubt, passt dieser Befund z. B. dazu, dass partieller Schlafentzug bei gesunden Probanden zu einer Reduktion des Hormons Leptin führt, welches eine wichtige Rolle bei der Hungerregulierung und dem Fettstoffwechsel spielt (Spiegel et al., ). So könnten diejenigen Insomniepatienten mit einem geringeren REM-Schlafanteil durch beispielsweise einen niedrigen Leptinspiegel mehr Nahrung aufnehmen bzw. mehr Fett speichern. Fragestellung: Neue Erkenntnisse stellen die Bedeutung des Apnoe-Hypopnoe-Index (AHI) für die Klassifizierung der obstruktiven Schlafapnoe (OSA) in Frage. Kürzlich wurde ein neuartiges Klassifikationssystem für den Schweregrad der OSA vorgeschlagen (\"Baveno-Klassifikation\", . Abb. ). Es umfasst die Symptombelastung und die Auswirkungen auf die Endorgane, um die Patienten in vier Gruppen zu klassifizieren. In der aktuellen Studie wurde diese Klassifikation in einer großen repräsentativen Patientenkohorte angewandt, um die Fähigkeit der Abgrenzung verschiedener OSA-Phänotypen zu evaluieren und schlafmedizinische Gruppenunterschiede zu prüfen. Patienten und Methoden: OSA-Patienten aus der Kohorte der European Sleep Apnoea Data Base (ESADA), die ab  in  Ländern erhoben wurde, wurden nach Symptomen (Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score ≥, subjektive Schlafdauer ≥ h, Diagnose Schlaflosigkeit) und den wichtigsten Auswirkungen auf die Endorgane (unkontrollierter arterieller Bluthochdruck, Vorhofflimmern, Herzinsuffizienz, Diabetes und Schlaganfall) kategorisiert. Ergebnisse: . Patienten ( % weibl,  ±  Jahre, BMI  ±  kg/m  ) wurden kategorisiert. Die Baveno-Klasse A-D erlaubt eine Abgrenzung verschiedener OSA-Phänotypen, die sich auch hinsichtlich schlafmedizinische Risikomarker unterscheiden. Die T war bei entweder schweren Symptomen oder schwerwiegenden Endorgan-Auswirkungen genauso wie der AHI erhöht. Beide Parameter steigen noch weiter an, wenn Tagesschläfrigkeit und Endorganschäden koexistierten (. Tab. ). So lässt sich jede einzelne Gruppe durch die verschiedenen klinischen Parameter einerseits und die hypoxische Last andererseits abgrenzen. Patienten und Methoden: Daten von . Patienten mit einem AHI≥/h der Europäischen Schlafapnoe-Datenbank (ESADA) wurden analysiert. Die Angaben für die Zuordnung zu den vier Baveno-Gruppen umfassten Symptome (ESS-Score, subjektive Schlafdauer, Insomnie) und Komorbiditäten (unkontrollierter arterieller Bluthochdruck, Vorhofflimmern, Herzinsuffizienz, Diabetes, Schlaganfall). ESS-Score und Blutdruck bei Therapiekontrolle  bis  Monate nach Therapieeinleitung wurden bei  Patienten untersucht. Ergebnisse: Die Verteilung der Patienten zum Diagnose-Zeitpunkt auf die Baveno-Gruppen war: A:  ( %), B:  ( %), C:  ( %) und D:  ( %). In allen Gruppen lag die Verschreibung einer Positivdruck-Therapie (PAP) bei - %. Die Compliance betrug bei Therapiekontrolle im Median , h/Tag. Die Einteilung nach AHI zeigte sowohl unbehandelte Patienten trotz Symptomen/Komorbiditäten, als auch behandelte Patienten trotz Fehlens von Symptomen/Komorbiditäten (. Abb. b). Die Relevanz der Baveno-Einteilung spiegelt sich im Therapieerfolg wider: Der Blutdruck zeigte sich in den Gruppen mit Komorbidität (C und D), der ESS in den symptomatischen Gruppen B und D signifikant gebessert (. Abb. a, b). Schlussfolgerungen: Die Klassifikation nach Baveno erlaubt tatsächlich die unmittelbare Identifikation jener Patienten, die prognostisch und/oder symptomatisch von einer Therapie profitieren. Da alle Bavenogruppen in den verschiedenen AHI-Schweregraden mit relevantem Anteil vertreten sind zeigt sie umgekehrt aber auch, dass eine Therapiesteuerung alleinig orientiert am AHI jene Patienten mit milder Schlafapnoe der Gruppen B, C, D unbehandelt ließe, die das Potenzial einer symptomatischen und/ oder prognostischen Besserung aufweisen. Die Bavenoklassifikation erlaubt weit besser als der AHI verschiedene OSA-Phänotypen abzubilden und das therapeutische Procedere festzulegen.

Neben soziodemografischen Daten und Angaben zu Home-Office und variablem Arbeitsbeginn (AB) wurden Arbeitsstress mit zwei Subskalen des Trierer Inventars zu chronischem Stress (TICS), Negativer und Positiver Affekt (NA, PA) mit der PANAS sowie die Schlafqualität (SQ) und Schlafdauer (SD) mit adaptierten Items des PSQIs erfasst. Zusätzlich wurde mit jeweils einem Item erfragt, ob sich die SQ bzw. SD im Vergleich zu vor COVID- verändert hat. Ergebnisse:  % bzw. , % der Teilnehmer gaben an, seit COVID- schlechter bzw. kürzer zu schlafen,  % bzw. , % gaben an besser bzw. länger zu schlafen. Berufstätige im Home-Office weisen einen variableren AB auf (r = ,**) und schlafen im Vergleich zur Zeit vor COVID- länger (-,**). Ein variabler AB ist mit einer schlechteren SQ (r = -,*) verbunden, hat aber keinen Einfluss auf die SD. Die SQ weist zudem Zusammenhänge mit Arbeitsstress (r = -,**), NA (r = -,**) und PA (r = ,**) auf, die SD lediglich einen Zusammenhang mit Arbeitsstress (r = -,**). Es zeigt sich weiter, dass eine höhere SQ mit einer längeren SD einhergeht (r = ,**). Bei der linearen Regression zur Vorhersage der SD durch Arbeitsstress und SQ erwies sich nur die SQ als signifikanter Prädiktor (. Abb. ). Die Ergebnisse der linearen Regression zur Vorhersage der SQ durch PA, NA, Arbeitsstress, variabler AB und SD zeigen, dass alle Prädiktoren, außer der Variable AB, einen signifikanten Einfluss auf die SQ aufweisen (. Abb. ). Schlussfolgerungen: Unsere Daten zeigen, dass die \"Baveno\"-Klassifikation tatsächlich in der Lage ist, vier verschiedene Phänotypen mit relevanter Häufigkeit in einer repräsentativen europäischen Patientenkohorte abzugrenzen. Unterschiede in der T, die bekanntermaßen mit schlechten kognitiven, kardiovaskulären und metabolischen Ergebnissen korreliert, lässt ein unterschiedliches Outcome der Bavenogruppen vermuten. Dies sollte in einer prospektiven Multicenter-Studie überprüft werden. Objectives: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has a high prevalence in the Swiss population (. % in men and . % in women) []. The currently used diagnostics with multichannel sleep studies is often cumbersome and more unobtrusive methods to diagnose SDB are desirable. Single-lead ECG has been investigated for the detection of SDB [, ]. With the emergence of optical heart rate monitoring (PPG) via wrist-worn devices, we investigated whether ECG-based algorithms could be translated to PPG signals for the detection of SDB. Methods: For the detection of SDB events, we used machine learning algorithms via heart rate variability (HRV). Initially, various algorithms were trained and tested on ECG-derived HRV from  subjects ( without SDB,  mild,  moderate,  severe SDB) from a public dataset of the MESA study []. Thereafter, the best performing algorithm was evaluated on  subjects ( without SDB,  mild,  moderate,  severe SDB) from a clinical study (NCT) at the Inselspital (Bern, Switzerland). Finally, we used the same algorithm to detect SDB events via HRV obtained from a wrist-worn PPG device from the same subjects. Results: On the first dataset (MESA) we obtained the following performance using ECG-derived HRV for the detection of SDB events: accuracy  %, sensitivity  %, specificity  %, and precision  %. On the second dataset (Inselspital) we obtained: accuracy  %, sensitivity  %, specificity  %, and precision  %. Using PPG-derived HRV from the second dataset resulted in: accuracy of  %, sensitivity  %, specificity  %, and precision  %. Conclusions: Compared to previous studies [, ], our algorithm was trained on a much larger dataset while the resulting performance remains comparable to both ECG-[] and PPG-based studies []. Therefore, we conclude that HRV features alone are not sufficient to reliably detect SDB events. Future work will focus on adding features related to oxygen saturation [] and PPG-derived respiration [] to improve SDB diagnostics using a wrist-worn device. Fragestellung: Koffein wird häufig verwendet, um die negativen Wirkungen von Schlafmangel auf die kognitive Leistung zu mildern. Da es bislang wenig wissenschaftliche Erkenntnis zur Frage gibt, für wie lange Koffein die kognitive Leistung bei chronischem Schlafmangel aufrechterhalten kann, untersuchten wir die Wirksamkeit von handelsüblichem Kaffee bei Personen mit genetisch-bedingt hoher Koffein-Sensitivität. Patienten und Methoden: Im Schlaflabor wurden  gesunde Probanden (Alter - Jahre) untersucht. Das sequentielle Design begann mit einer Adaptations-und zwei Basisnächten mit je -stündiger Bettzeit (TIB), an die sich  weitere Tage anschlossen, die in  Gruppen variiert wurden. Die Kontrollgruppe (n = ,  Frauen (F)) hatte immer  h TIB. Die Restriktionsgruppe (n = ,  F) verbrachte  Nächte mit  h TIB (experimentelle Studientage E-E), denen eine Erholungsnacht (Studientag Rec) mit  h TIB folgte. Die Koffeingruppe (n = ,  F) hatte dieselben Schlafzeiten wie die Restriktionsgruppe, erhielt aber standardisiert  g Kaffee (∼ mg Koffein) pro Tag während E-E und  g Kaffee (∼ mg Koffein) an E. Die entkoffeinierte Gruppe (n = ,  F) durchlief dasselbe Design wie die Koffeingruppe, erhielt jedoch entkoffeinierten Kaffee. Für die beiden Kaffee-Gruppen wurden Träger des C/ C-Allels des Adenosin-AA-Rezeptors (ADORA c.) selektiert. Ergebnisse: Die Gruppen wurden mittels einer gemischten ANOVA mit Bonferroni-Korrektur (α < ,) hinsichtlich ihrer Verschlechterung in der Tagesleistung (Differenzen zum . Basistag in der Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit (/Reaktionszeit) zum Zeitpunkt , ,  und  h wach) in einem -minütigen Psychomotorischen Vigilanztest verglichen. Die Restriktionsgruppe war langsamer als die Kontrollgruppe von E-E (p < ,), aber nicht während Rec (p = ,). Die Koffeingruppe war schneller als die entkoffeinierte Gruppe an E (p = ,) und auch schneller als die Restriktionsgruppe während E und E (p < ,). Von E bis Rec war die Koffeingruppe jedoch langsamer als die Kontrollgruppe (p < ,). Die entkoffeinierte Gruppe reagierte schneller als die Restriktionsgruppe zum Zeitpunkt  h wach an E und E. Sie war jedoch langsamer als die Kontrollgruppe von E-E (p < ,), aber nicht während Rec (p = ,). Schlussfolgerungen: Bei Koffein-sensitiven Personen vermochten ∼ mg Koffein die kognitive Leistung für zwei Tage auf einem ausgeschlafenen Niveau zu halten, führten jedoch zu einer verzögerten Erholung. Auch entkoffeinierter Kaffee entfaltete kurzfristig positive Wirkungen.

            " Methods: A protocol was prepared according to meta-analyses guidelines. Study selection was all RCTs conducted in adult narcoleptic patients (ANP) assessing at least one of the  treatments and placebo. Univariate meta-analyses were performed separately for ESS, MWT and CAR, and confirmed by a multivariate comparison based on an agregating Z-score. Safety index was the Adverse Events incidence (AEI). Finally, a Risk/Efficacy index was calculated as a summary mean of Efficacy and Safety Zscore. A NMA was needed due to the multiple treatment comparison and multi-arm studies needing correction on correlation matrix. The random model was assumed due to the expected between studies heterogeneity. Results: In ANP, Modafinil/Armodafinil (MDF), sodium oxybate (SXB) and Pitolisant (P), demonstrated their efficacy to reduce EDS; P and SXB demonstrated their efficacy to reduce CAR.  studies were included in the NMA,  treatments groups were considered: MDF - mg/ d, SXB  g/d (SXB) and  g/d (SXB) and P up to  mg/d (P) and up to  mg/d (P), and placebo. Placebo was considered as the reference value. SXB, MDF and P were significantly different from placebo for ESS, MWT and CAR. In the ranking of treatments performed according to P-scores (Equivalent Sucra Values) and for all the efficacy endpoints confirmed by the multivariate meta-analysis, the highest treatment effect was found for P, followed by SXB and MDF. The best safety profile compared with placebo was for Pitolisant (all doses), followed by Modafinil. SXB was characterized by a higher AEI. Finally, the best Risk/Benefit index was observed with P.\n",

            "EFSA requested its Scientific Committee to prepare a guidance document on appraising and integrating evidence from epidemiological studies for use in EFSA's scientific assessments. The guidance document provides an introduction to epidemiological studies and illustrates the typical biases of the different epidemiological study designs. It describes key epidemiological concepts relevant for evidence appraisal. Regarding study reliability, measures of association, exposure assessment, statistical inferences, systematic error and effect modification are explained. Regarding study relevance, the guidance describes the concept of external validity. The principles of appraising epidemiological studies are illustrated, and an overview of Risk of Bias (RoB) tools is given. A decision tree is developed to assist in the selection of the appropriate Risk of Bias tool, depending on study question, population and design. The customisation of the study appraisal process is explained, detailing the use of RoB tools and assessing the risk of bias in the body of evidence. Several examples of appraising experimental and observational studies using a Risk of Bias tool are annexed to the document to illustrate the application of the approach. This document constitutes a draft that will be applied in EFSA's assessments during a -year pilot phase and be revised and complemented as necessary. Before finalisation of the document, a public consultation will be launched. \n",

            "Control measures directed at carriers of multidrug-resistant organisms are traditionally approached as a trade-off between public interests on the one hand and individual autonomy on the other. We propose to reframe the ethical issue and consider control measures directed at carriers an issue of solidarity. Rather than asking \"whether it is justified to impose strict measures\", we propose asking \"how to best care for a person's carriership and well-being in ways that do not imply an unacceptable risk for others?\". A solidarity approach could include elevating baseline levels of precaution measures and accepting certain risks in cases where there is exceptionally much at stake. A generous national compensation policy that also covers for costs related to dedicated care is essential in a solidarity approach. An additional benefit of reframing the questions is that it helps to better acknowledge that being subjected to control measures is a highly personal matter. \n",

            " Epidemiological evidence has shown the association between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM) and increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral respiratory infections. However, to date, the underlying mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of PM remain unclear. Our objective was to explore how exposure to relatively low doses of urban air PM alters innate responses to bacterial and viral stimuli in vitro. We used secondary alveolar epithelial cell line along with monocyte-derived macrophages to replicate innate lung barrier in vitro. Co-cultured cells were first exposed for  hours to PM .- (particle aerodynamic diameter between  and .µm) and subsequently for an additional  hours to lipopolysaccharide (TLR), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (TLR), and synthetic single-stranded RNA oligoribonucleotides (TLR/) to mimic bacterial or viral stimulation. Toxicological endpoints included pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-, IL-, and TNF-α), cellular metabolic activity, and cell cycle phase distribution. We show that cells exposed to PM .- produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation with bacterial TLR ligand than cells exposed to PM .- or bacterial ligand alone.\n",
            " On the contrary, PM .- exposure reduced pro-inflammatory responses to viral ligands TLR and TLR/. Cell cycle analysis indicated that viral ligands induced cell cycle arrest at the G-M phase. In PM-primed co-cultures, however, they failed to induce the G-M phase arrest.\n",
            " Contrarily, bacterial stimulation caused a slight increase in cells in the sub-G phase but in PM .- primed co-cultures the effect of bacterial stimulation was masked by PM .-.

            "As the world continues to deal with climate-induced heat events, sustainable energy behaviours, or lifestyles combined with non-behavioural interventions have been identified as crucial pathways to curb the demand for air conditioners. Typically, ecological communities serve as a reference point for sustainable lifestyles as they have strong environmental self-identity and values and are more likely to further engage in pro-environmental and energy-saving actions. Yet, it is unknown if individuals within these communities will act as expected, especially when confronted with extreme climatic challenges like heatwaves. It is also unclear which factors will define individual responses to these challenges. Utilising environmental self-identity and Value-Belief-Norm theories, this paper examines factors underlying cooling consumption behaviours of households living in a Universal Community with strong environmental world views in India. Twenty in-depth qualitative interviews with residents, thematically analysed, found that while people expressed strong environmental self-identity, preferences for air conditioner use was often mediated by hedonic factors such as comfort and sleep. Moral norms played a positive role in how people operated their air conditioners. Yet, when faced with the choice of using energy-efficient air conditioners, biospheric concern was of limited importance while situational factors like cost and functionality were more pivotal. The above results raise interesting questions around the difficulties that might emerge in changing preferences around air conditioning behaviours in non-environmental communities, especially, if environmentally conscious communities which are expected to be \"the locus of change for energy efficiency actions\" are significantly influenced by hedonic values. \n",

In this paper, a detailed comparison is given of the behavior of continuous and discrete models for two representative time-delay models, namely a model for HIV and an extended logistic growth model. For each model, there are seven different time-delay versions because there are seven different positions to include time delays. For the seven different time-delay versions of each model, proofs are given of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov-Hopf bifurcations in the differential equations and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations in the difference equations. We show that only five of the seven time-delay versions have bifurcations and that all bifurcation versions have supercritical limit cycles with one having a repelling cycle and four having attracting cycles. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the analytical results and to show that critical times for Neimark-Sacker bifurcations are less than critical times for Andronov-Hopf bifurcations but converge to them as the time step of the discretization tends to zero.

Research on these topics would enhance our knowledge of this virus and help us develop vaccines or predict its paths of mutations. There are many theoretical and clinical researches in this area. In this article, we devise a structural metric which directly measures the structural differences between any two nucleotide sequences. In order to explore the mechanisms of how the evolution works, we associate the nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV- and its related families with the degrees of randomness. Since the distances between randomly generated nucleotide sequences are very concentrated around a mean with low variance, they are qualified as good candidates for the fundamental reference. Such reference could then be applied to measure the randomness of other Coronaviridae sequences. Our findings show that the relative randomness ratios are very consistent and concentrated. This result indicates their randomness is very stable and predictable. The findings also reveal the evolutional behaviours between the Coronaviridae and all its subfamilies. \n",

            " pathogens into novel host species have a long history in biomedical research. This provides a rich  and largely unexploited data source for meta-analyses to identify the host and pathogen  determinants of variability in infection outcomes. Here, we analysed the progressions of   experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, a widespread zoonotic pathogen which in  nature exhibits both dead end infections and varying levels of sustained transmission in novel hosts.  Inoculations originating from bats rather than carnivores, and from warmer to cooler-bodied  species caused infections with shorter incubation periods that were associated with diminished  virus excretion. Inoculations between distantly related hosts tended to result in shorter clinical  disease periods, which will also impede transmission. All effects were modulated by infection dose  and together suggest that increased virulence as host species become more dissimilar is the limiting  factor preventing onward transmission. These results explain observed constraints on rabies virus  host shifts, allow us to evaluate the risk of novel reservoirs establishing, and give mechanistic  insights into why host shifts are less likely between genetically distant species. More generally, our  study highlights meta-analyses of experimental infections as a tractable approach to quantify the  complex interactions between virus, reservoir, and novel host that shape the outcome of cross- species transmission. \n",
            " Emerging disease epidemics often result from a pathogen establishing transmission in a novel host  species. However, most cross-species transmissions fail to establish in the newly infected species  for reasons that remain poorly understood. Examining cross-species inoculations involving rabies,  a widespread viral zoonosis, we show that mismatches in virulence, which are predictable from  host and viral factors, make sustained transmission in the novel host less likely. In particular,  disease progression was accelerated and virus excretion decreased when the reservoir and novel  host were physiologically or genetically more dissimilar. These mechanistic insights help to  explain and predict host shift events and highlight meta-analyses of existing experimental  inoculation data as a powerful and generalisable approach for understanding the dynamics of index  infections in novel species.  Ogbu et al., ). Cross-species transmission is also the first step towards host shifts, where  pathogens establish transmission cycles in novel hosts (Wolfe et al., ). While the broader-scale  epidemiological and ecological factors driving cross-species transmission are beginning to be  understood (reviewed in Lloyd-Smith et al., ; Plowright et al., , ), we remain unable  to anticipate whether cross-species transmission will cause 'dead-end' infections or lead to  sustained transmission. Infection dynamics at the cross-species interface, specifically the  probability of infection given exposure and the progression of index infections in novel hosts, are  generally unobservable in nature. This is a crucial gap given that the outcomes of cross-species  infections have profound implications for host shifts and disease emergence. \n",
            " Cross-infection studies, in which viruses from a natural reservoir are experimentally inoculated  into novel host species, provide a rare view into the dynamics of index infections. Since the dose,  route, timing and origin of viral exposure are known, these factors can be controlled for to identify  the ecological and evolutionary rules that govern the outcomes of cross-species transmission. We  focus on Rabies lyssavirus (family Rhabdoviridae) as a model pathogen for understanding cross- species transmission (Fisher et al., ). Rabies virus is a zoonotic RNA virus, transmitted through  an infectious bite, that infects all mammals and, untreated, has the highest case fatality ratio of any  infectious disease (Hemachudha et al., ; Rupprecht et al., ) . Rabies virus naturally infects  multiple carnivore and bat species, which each perpetuate species-specific maintenance cycles  (Mollentze et al., ) . Although most cross-species transmission events do not lead to onward  transmission, each maintenance cycle represents a rare past cross-species transmission event that  established transmission in a novel host. Dead-end cross-species transmissions and historical host  shifts are detectable in rabies virus phylogenies, and epidemiological surveillance reveals that  nascent hosts shifts remain commonplace (Kuzmin et al., ; Mollentze et al., ; Streicker et  al., ). As such, rabies virus exhibits extensive variation in the epidemiological outcomes of  cross-species transmission. Here, we exploit cross-infection studies conducted over several  decades, in which diverse mammalian species were inoculated with rabies viruses of bat and \n",

            "Purpose of Review This investigation aims to understand the role and burden of viral co-infections for acute respiratory illnesses in children. Co-infection can be either viral-viral or viral-bacterial and with new technology there is more information on the role they play on the health of children. Recent Findings With the proliferation of multiplex PCR for rapid diagnosis of multiple viruses as well as innovations on identification of bacterial infections, research has been attempting to discover how these co-infections affect each other and the host. Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level. Studies are also attempting to discover the burden of morbidity and mortality of these viral-viral co-infections on the pediatric population. It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. Summary RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space. Future research needs to focus on confirming these conclusions as it could affect hospital cohorting, role of molecular testing, and therapeutic interventions. \n",

            "Virus adaptation to new hosts is a major cause of infectious disease emergence. This mechanism has been intensively studied in the context of zoonotic virus spillover, due to its impact on global health. However, it remains unclear for virophages, parasites of giant viruses and potential regulators of microbial communities. Here, we present, for the first time to our knowledge, evidence of cross-species infection of a virophage. We demonstrated that challenging the native population of Guarani virophage with two previously unidentified giant viruses, previously nonpermissive to this virophage, allows the selection of a mutant genotype able to infect these giant viruses. We were able to characterize the potential genetic determinant (deletion) carried by the virophage with the expanded-host range. Our study also highlights the relevant biological impact of this host adaptation by demonstrating that coinfection with the mixture containing the mutant virophage abolishes giant virus production and rescues the host cell population from lysis. \n",

            "Coronaviruses are able to establish persistence. However, how coronaviruses react to persistence and whether the selected viruses have altered their characteristics remain unclear. In this study, we found that the persistent infection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), which is in the same genus as SARS-COV-, led to alterations of genome structure, attenuation of gene expression, and the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) with a previously unidentified pattern. Subsequent analyses revealed that the altered genome structures were associated with the attenuation of gene expression. In addition, the genome structure at the  terminus and the cellular environment during the persistence were responsible for the sgmRNA synthesis, solving the previously unanswered question regarding the selection of transcription regulatory sequence for synthesis of BCoV sgmRNA .. Although the BCoV variants (BCoV-p) selected under the persistence replicated efficiently in cells without persistent infection, its pathogenicity was still lower than that of wild-type (wt) BCoV. Furthermore, in comparison with wt BCoV, the variant BCoV-p was not able to efficiently adapt to the challenges of alternative environments, suggesting wt BCoV is genetically robust. We anticipate that the findings derived from this fundamental research can contribute to the disease control and treatments against coronavirus infection including SARS-CoV-. \n",

We investigated whether monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for tetanus could cross-react with Chlamydia and confer heterologous protection against chlamydial infection. The capability of two tetanus-specific mAbs, namely mAb and mAb, to prevent chlamydial infection has been assessed: (i) in vitro, by performing a neutralization assay using human conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cells infected with Chlamydia trachomatis serovar B, and (ii) in vivo, by using a guinea pig model of Chlamydia caviae-induced inclusion conjunctivitis. The mAb has been superior in comparison with mAb in the prevention of chlamydial infection in HCjE cells. The mAb has conferred ≈% inhibition of the infection, compared to less than % inhibition in the presence of the mAb. In vivo, mAb significantly diminished ocular pathology intensity in guinea pigs infected with C. caviae compared to either the mAb-treated or sham-treated guinea pigs.

            "Vaccines are one of the most powerful technologies supporting public health. The adaptive immune response induced by immunization arises following appropriate activation and differentiation of T and B cells in lymph nodes. Among many parameters impacting the resulting immune response, the presence of antigen and inflammatory cues for an appropriate temporal duration within the lymph nodes, and further within appropriate subcompartments of the lymph nodes-the right timing and location-play a critical role in shaping cellular and humoral immunity. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of how vaccine kinetics and biodistribution impact adaptive immunity, and the underlying immunological mechanisms that govern these responses. We discuss emerging approaches to engineer these properties for future vaccines, with a focus on subunit vaccines.

            " Within lymph nodes, T cells and B cells are compartmentalized into specific sites, with T cells residing primarily in the paracortex deeper in the lymph nodes while B cells reside in follicles (Fig. ) . Vaccine particles carried to the lymph node by lymph or in lymph-migrating APCs arrive at the subcapsular sinus of the draining lymph node. The sinus is lined by a layer of macrophages and epithelial cells that form a barrier limiting access to the LN parenchyma. Material in the sinus can either drain to the medullary sinuses and subsequently exit the node through efferent lymphatics, which travel to the next lymph node in the chain, be passed into the LN parenchyma via gated, narrow collagen conduits [] [] [] [] , or be physically captured and transferred across the sinus barrier by sinus-lining macrophages [, ] .\n",
            " Transport within the lymph node impacts access of antigen/adjuvant compounds to key cells moderating lymphocyte activation: dendritic cells that specialize in priming CD + helper vs. CD + cytolytic T cells are localized in distinct sites, with CD-priming DCs located deeper in the paracortex [, ] . B cells that receive initial signaling by binding to cognate antigens enter specialized subregions of the follicles termed germinal centers (GCs), which are split into a light zone and a dark zone. Follicular dendritic cells in the light zone capture and retain antigen via Fc and complement receptors, which they can present for prolonged periods to local B cells [, ] . Within the GC, B cells undergo the cyclic process of affinity maturation: In the dark zone, B cells proliferate and mutate their antigen receptors; as a round of proliferation ends, GC B cells migrate to the light zone, where they can acquire antigen from FDCs that is processed and presented on class II MHC to follicular helper T cells (Tfh). Tfh cells play a crucial role in providing survival and costimulatory cues to B cells that determine the amount of proliferation and antigen receptor mutation they carry out on returning to the dark zone, and competition among B cell clones for Tfh help determines the outcome of the GC response [] [] [] . B cells which fail to receive sufficient signals from Tfh undergo apoptosis [] . B cells can exit the GC to become short-lived antibody producing cells termed plasmablasts, long-lived antibodyproducing plasma cells, or memory cells; the cues governing these fate decisions remain poorly understood. B cell-Tfh interactions are ultimately governed by the antigen acquired by the GC B cell [] , and the amount of antigen accumulated in lymph nodes directly correlates with the number of Tfh and GC B cells that develop in immunized lymph nodes [] . Thus, the efficiency of antigen delivery to FDCs will also affect responses to immunization.\n",

            " A classic fundamental function of vaccine adjuvants has been thought to be the promotion of cell-mediated trafficking of antigen to draining lymph nodes. In general, this mode of vaccine delivery is promoted by attracting migratory immune cells to the injection site from the local tissue or the blood, which can internalize antigen and subsequently migrate to the draining lymphatic vessels to carry vaccine components to the draining LN (Fig. , pathway ) . Two licensed adjuvants, alum ( Fig. A) and MF (Fig. B , an oil-in-water nanoemulsion), are thought to promote vaccine responses in large part through such mechanisms [] . Both alum and MF induce the local production of chemokines recruiting neutrophils, monocytes, DCs, and macrophages to the injection site [, , ] . These recruited cells subsequently take up antigen and transport it to draining lymph nodes, increasing the amount of antigen + cells compared to antigen alone and triggering activation of APCs in the dLNs [, ] .

In this paper, a detailed comparison is given of the behavior of continuous and discrete models for two representative time-delay models, namely a model for HIV and an extended logistic growth model. For each model, there are seven different time-delay versions because there are seven different positions to include time delays. For the seven different time-delay versions of each model, proofs are given of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov-Hopf bifurcations in the differential equations and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations in the difference equations. We show that only five of the seven time-delay versions have bifurcations and that all bifurcation versions have supercritical limit cycles with one having a repelling cycle and four having attracting cycles. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the analytical results and to show that critical times for Neimark-Sacker bifurcations are less than critical times for Andronov-Hopf bifurcations but converge to them as the time step of the discretization tends to zero.

The presence  of WL from a minor population to become the predominant population suggests that this site  may be under immune selection pressure in this patient. Neutralizing antibodies against N- terminal domain could be found in COVID- patients [-], and may neutralize virus  infection for several reasons. First, Chi et al postulated that the antibody may prevent the  conformational change of the S protein which is necessary for fusion []. Second, antibody  against N-terminal domain may block the spike protein that binds to an unidentified receptor.  The N-terminal domain of S subunit has been shown to participate in binding for other  coronaviruses. The human coronaviruses OC and HKU has been shown to bind to -O- acetylated sialic acids, while MERS-CoV- binds to non-acetylated sialic acid, via the N- terminal domain [,]. The mouse hepatitis virus binds to host cell receptor carcinoembryonic  antigen-related cell adhesion molecule via the S N-terminal domain [].  Although nucleotide changes are frequent, amino acid mutation is actually an infrequent  event for the spike gene [], except for DG which now accounts for the majority of the  SARS-CoV- reported worldwide []. Mutations at spike protein amino acid residue  are  rarely found, accounting for <.% of the strains deposited in GISAID as of September ,  . The low prevalence of WL mutation suggest that this mutation may confer reduced  fitness or transmissibility. However, since usually only one viral sequence from each patient  would be deposited into public databases, the prevalence of WL mutation may have been  underestimated.  Our patient with WL mutation was treated with ribavirin and lopinavir-ritonavir  which started between the collection of the first and second specimen. Our previous clinical trial  J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f  Our study demonstrates that mutations may arise spontaneously at neutralizing antibody  sites during the course of COVID-. Although these mutations may not be sustained during  person-to-person transmission, these amino acid mutations may affect the antiviral activity of  neutralizing antibodies. Monitoring for intrahost mutational hotspots are warranted. Serial  monitoring of mutations is needed for clinical trials on monoclonal antibody therapeutic trials.

The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites mutated across all strains and individual samples of the SARS-Cov- genome; given the high cost and limited availability of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, especially in early stages of infections when only a small number of genomic samples (∼ s) are available that do not allow for determining the exact degree of mutations in an RNA virus that comprises roughly ,  nucleotides. Nevertheless, working with small sample sets is required in order to quickly predict the mutation rate of this and other viruses and get an insight into their transformational power. Furthermore, with the small number of samples available, it is hard to estimate the mutational landscape across different age/gender groups and geographical locations which may be of great importance in assessing different risk categories and factors influencing susceptibility to infection. To this end, we use our state-of-the art polynomial estimator techniques and the Good-Turing estimator to obtain estimates based on only roughly ,  samples per category. Our analysis reveals an interesting finding: the mutational support appears to be statistically more significant in patients which appear to have lower infection rates and handle the exposure with milder symptoms, such as women and people of relatively young age (≤ ). \n",

            "The discovery and characterization of novel arthropod-borne viruses provide valuable information on their genetic diversity, ecology, evolution and potential to threaten animal or public health. Arbovirus surveillance is not conducted regularly in Romania, being particularly very scarce in the remote and diverse areas like the Danube Delta. Here we describe the detection and genetic characterization of a novel orbivirus (Reoviridae: Orbivirus) designated as Letea virus, which was found in grass snakes (Natrix natrix) during a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic survey conducted between  and . This virus is the first orbivirus discovered in reptiles. Phylogenetic analyses placed Letea virus as a highly divergent species in the Culicoides-/sand fly-borne orbivirus clade. Gene reassortment and intragenic recombination were detected in the majority of the nine Letea virus strains obtained, implying that these mechanisms play important roles in the evolution and diversification of the virus. However, the screening of arthropods, including Culicoides biting midges collected within the same surveillance program, tested negative for Letea virus infection and could not confirm the arthropod vector of the virus. The study provided complete genome sequences for nine Letea virus strains and new information about orbivirus diversity, host range, ecology and evolution. The phylogenetic associations warrant further screening of arthropods, as well as sustained surveillance efforts for elucidation of Letea virus natural cycle and possible implications for animal and human health. \n",

            "Organisms differ in the types and numbers of tRNA genes that they carry. While the evolutionary mechanisms behind tRNA gene set evolution have been investigated theoretically and computationally, direct observations of tRNA gene set evolution remain rare. Here, we report the evolution of a tRNA gene set in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW. The growth defect caused by deleting the single-copy tRNA gene, serCGA, is rapidly compensated by large-scale (- kb) duplications in the chromosome. Each duplication encompasses a second, compensatory tRNA gene (serTGA) and is associated with a rise in tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool. We postulate that tRNA-Ser(CGA) elimination increases the translational demand for tRNA-Ser(UGA), a pressure relieved by increasing serTGA copy number. This work demonstrates that tRNA gene sets can evolve through duplication of existing tRNA genes, a phenomenon that may contribute to the presence of multiple, identical tRNA gene copies within genomes.\n",

            "This study aims to highlight SARS-COV- mutations which are associated with increased or decreased viral virulence. We utilize, genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries' regional information such as deaths and cases per million as well as covid--related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (PL) and ORFa (QH). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein. \n",

            "Screening and diagnostic tests are used to classify people with and without a disease. Diagnostic accuracy measures are used to evaluate the correctness of a classification in clinical research and practice. Although this depends on the uncertainty of measurement, there has been limited research on their relation. The objective of this work was to develop an exploratory tool for the relation between diagnostic accuracy measures and measurement uncertainty, as diagnostic accuracy is fundamental to clinical decision-making, while measurement uncertainty is critical to quality and risk management in laboratory medicine. For this reason, a freely available interactive program was developed for calculating, optimizing, plotting and comparing various diagnostic accuracy measures and the corresponding risk of diagnostic or screening tests measuring a normally distributed measurand, applied at a single point in time in non-diseased and diseased populations. This is done for differing prevalence of the disease, mean and standard deviation of the measurand, diagnostic threshold, standard measurement uncertainty of the tests and expected loss. The application of the program is illustrated with a case study of glucose measurements in diabetic and non-diabetic populations. The program is user-friendly and can be used as an educational and research tool in medical decision-making. \n",

Materials and methods We targeted individuals with possible CT findings of viral pneumonia. Using an online questionnaire, we asked Japanese board-certified radiologists to register their patients' information including patient age and sex, the CT examination date, the results of PCR test for COVID- infection, CT findings, and the postal code of the medical institution that performed the CT. We compared the diurnal patient number and the cumulative regional distribution map of registrations in CT-surveillance to those of the PCR-positive patient surveillance (PCR-surveillance). Results A total of  patients was registered from January  to April ,  for CT-surveillance. Their PCR test results were positive (n = .-%), negative (n = .-%), unknown (n = .-%), and other disease (n = .-%). An age peak at - years and male dominance were observed in CT-surveillance. The most common CT finding was bilaterally distributed ground-glass opacities. The diurnal number and the cumulative regional distribution map by CT-surveillance showed tendencies that were similar to those revealed by PCR-surveillance. Conclusion Using clinical CT data, CT-surveillance program delineated the epidemiologic features of COVID- infection. \n",

            "Early detection surveillance is used for various purposes, including the early detection of non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer screening), of unusual increases of disease frequency (e.g. influenza or pertussis outbreaks), and the first occurrence of a disease in a previously free population. This latter purpose is particularly important due to the high consequences and cost of delayed detection of a disease moving to a new population.\n",
            " Quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance allows important aspects of the performance of different systems, approaches and authorities to be evaluated, compared and improved. While quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity of other branches of surveillance has been available for many years, development has lagged in the area of early detection, arguably one of the most important purposes of surveillance. This paper, using mostly animal health examples, develops a simple approach to quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance, in terms of population coverage, temporal coverage and detection sensitivity. This approach is extended to quantify the benefits of risk-based approaches to early detection surveillance. Population-based clinical surveillance (based on either farmers and their veterinarians, or patients and their local health services) provides the best combination of sensitivity, practicality and cost-effectiveness. These systems can be significantly enhanced by removing disincentives to reporting, for instance by implementing effective strategies to improve farmer awareness and engagement with health services and addressing the challenges of well-intentioned disease notification policies that inadvertently impose barriers to reporting.\n",

Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are typically used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and malaria; they have been considered for offlabel and compassionate use in several countries against moderate to severe cases of COVID- and there's actually a massive demand of these two drugs. The aim of this paper is to briefly review the published literature, summarizing evidences about audiological implications after CQ and HCQ treatment.\n",
            " May  to  May . We combined MeSH terms of \"chloroquine\", \"hydroxychloroquine\", \"ototoxicity\", \"hearing loss\", \"tinnitus\", \"deafness\" and \"hearing\". Publications with relevant data were included. Selected data (authors, country and year; sample size; study design; audiological side effects) were extracted and summarised in a table.\n",
            " Of  initial studies,  met inclusion criteria. The authors found xix cases of HCQ ototoxicity; Tinnitus was reported in  cases, and it was found to be reversible or irreversible.\n",
            " Sensorineural hearing loss after HCQ use was reported in  patients; it was found to be irreversible or partially reversible after discontinuation of HCQ in  cases. Eight papers reporting CQ ototoxicity were; tinnitus was not reported by any authors. Sensorineural hearing loss after taking CQ was reported in  patients; it was found to be irreversible after discontinuation of CQ in  patients. One patient showed abnormal gait after a single intramuscular injection of CQ. Thirteen patients' Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) were found to be abnormal, but they resolved after CQ discontinuation.\n",

            "BACKGROUND: While institution-sponsored wellness programs may be effective, little is known about their availability and utilization in pediatric subspecialists, and about programs physicians wish were available. METHODS: A survey of perceptions about, and availability and utilization of institutional wellness activities, was distributed electronically to pediatric subspecialists nationally. Bivariate analyses were performed using χ  tests or independent t tests. Multivariable logistic regression models for categories of institution-sponsored programming as a function of potential predictors of program utilization were performed. Qualitative content analysis was performed for free-text survey answers. RESULTS: Approximately % of respondents participated in institution-sponsored wellness opportunities. Debriefs, Schwartz Center Rounds, mental health services, and team building events were the most available institution-sponsored wellness activities, whereas debriefs, team building, Schwartz Center Rounds, and pet therapy were most frequently utilized. Respondents desired greater social/emotional support, improved leadership, enhanced organizational support, and modifications to the physical work environment, with no significant differences across subspecialties for \"wish list\" items. CONCLUSIONS: Physician wellness requires more than a \"one-size-fits-all\" initiative. Our data highlight the importance of encouraging and normalizing self-care practices, and of listening to what physicians articulate about their needs. Preimplementation needs assessment allows a \"bottom-up\" approach where physician voices can be heard. \n",

            " Objectives: Sleep is a complex physiological process regulated by various brain circuits and neurotransmitter systems. Empirical research has clearly demonstrated that different aspects of sleep health are related to future morbidity and mortality. However, it is unclear whether neurostructural abnormalities underlie different aspects of sleep health. Several small-scale cross-sectional case-control studies have supported this hypothesis; however, the results so far are somewhat inconclusive. Thus, in light of recent doubts about replicability and low power in neuroimaging studies, the current study seeks to investigate the independent associations between several sleep health variables and brain morphometry in a large sample of individuals of the UK Biobank (UKBB, current results are based on a sample of n = ,; results presented in Sevilla will be based on an updated sample of n = ,). Methods: Cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank (Sudlow et al., ) was analyzed using multiple linear regression models with sleep health variables (insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness and chronotype) as concurrently included independent variables. Covariates Fragestellung: Bei Patienten mit mangelhafter Nutzung einer positiven Atemwegsdruck-Therapie (PAP) wird ein Maskenwechsel häufig in der klinischen Routine eingesetzt.

Fragestellung: Epidemiologische Studien weisen darauf hin, dass Schlafdauer und -qualität mit der Entstehung von Übergewicht zusammenhängen könnten (z. B. Taheri et al., ). Die Verteilung des Köperfetts wurde bis jetzt nur von wenigen Studien berücksichtigt. Ziel dieser Studie ist es, den Zusammenhang von Schlafparametern und der Körperzusammensetzung bei Patienten mit Insomnie zu untersuchen. Patienten und Methoden: Eingeschlossen wurden neun Insomniepatientinnen (Alter:  ±  Jahre, BMI: , ± , kg/m  ). Die Untersuchungen im Rahmen der Studie umfassten zwei Nächte Polysomnographie, die Messung der Fettmasse und der fettfreien Masse mittels Air Displacement Plethysmography, sowie eine Messung des subkutanen und viszeralen Fettanteils mittels abdominaler Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT). Ergebnisse: Die durchschnittliche Schlafdauer betrug  ±  min, die REM-Schlafdauer  ±  min und die Schlafeffizienz  ±  %. Die Fettmasse lag bei , ± , kg und die fettfreie Masse bei , ± , kg. Die MRT-Untersuchung ergab einen viszeralen Fettanteil von , ± , Litern und einen subkutanen Fettanteil von , ± , Litern. Das Hauptergebnis war eine signifikante negative Partialkorrelation (Kontrolliert für Alter) der subkutanen (r = -,) und viszeralen Fettmasse (r = -,) mit der REM-Schlafdauer, nicht aber mit nonREM-Schlaf Parametern. Schlussfolgerungen: Diese Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass vor allem die REM-Schlafdauer bei der Entwicklung von Übergewicht bei Insomnie eine Rolle spielen könnte. Obwohl diese Studie keine Aussage zur Kausalität erlaubt, passt dieser Befund z. B. dazu, dass partieller Schlafentzug bei gesunden Probanden zu einer Reduktion des Hormons Leptin führt, welches eine wichtige Rolle bei der Hungerregulierung und dem Fettstoffwechsel spielt (Spiegel et al., ). So könnten diejenigen Insomniepatienten mit einem geringeren REM-Schlafanteil durch beispielsweise einen niedrigen Leptinspiegel mehr Nahrung aufnehmen bzw. mehr Fett speichern. Fragestellung: Neue Erkenntnisse stellen die Bedeutung des Apnoe-Hypopnoe-Index (AHI) für die Klassifizierung der obstruktiven Schlafapnoe (OSA) in Frage. Kürzlich wurde ein neuartiges Klassifikationssystem für den Schweregrad der OSA vorgeschlagen (\"Baveno-Klassifikation\", . Abb. ). Es umfasst die Symptombelastung und die Auswirkungen auf die Endorgane, um die Patienten in vier Gruppen zu klassifizieren. In der aktuellen Studie wurde diese Klassifikation in einer großen repräsentativen Patientenkohorte angewandt, um die Fähigkeit der Abgrenzung verschiedener OSA-Phänotypen zu evaluieren und schlafmedizinische Gruppenunterschiede zu prüfen. Patienten und Methoden: OSA-Patienten aus der Kohorte der European Sleep Apnoea Data Base (ESADA), die ab  in  Ländern erhoben wurde, wurden nach Symptomen (Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score ≥, subjektive Schlafdauer ≥ h, Diagnose Schlaflosigkeit) und den wichtigsten Auswirkungen auf die Endorgane (unkontrollierter arterieller Bluthochdruck, Vorhofflimmern, Herzinsuffizienz, Diabetes und Schlaganfall) kategorisiert. Ergebnisse: . Patienten ( % weibl,  ±  Jahre, BMI  ±  kg/m  ) wurden kategorisiert. Die Baveno-Klasse A-D erlaubt eine Abgrenzung verschiedener OSA-Phänotypen, die sich auch hinsichtlich schlafmedizinische Risikomarker unterscheiden. Die T war bei entweder schweren Symptomen oder schwerwiegenden Endorgan-Auswirkungen genauso wie der AHI erhöht. Beide Parameter steigen noch weiter an, wenn Tagesschläfrigkeit und Endorganschäden koexistierten (. Tab. ). So lässt sich jede einzelne Gruppe durch die verschiedenen klinischen Parameter einerseits und die hypoxische Last andererseits abgrenzen. Patienten und Methoden: Daten von . Patienten mit einem AHI≥/h der Europäischen Schlafapnoe-Datenbank (ESADA) wurden analysiert. Die Angaben für die Zuordnung zu den vier Baveno-Gruppen umfassten Symptome (ESS-Score, subjektive Schlafdauer, Insomnie) und Komorbiditäten (unkontrollierter arterieller Bluthochdruck, Vorhofflimmern, Herzinsuffizienz, Diabetes, Schlaganfall). ESS-Score und Blutdruck bei Therapiekontrolle  bis  Monate nach Therapieeinleitung wurden bei  Patienten untersucht. Ergebnisse: Die Verteilung der Patienten zum Diagnose-Zeitpunkt auf die Baveno-Gruppen war: A:  ( %), B:  ( %), C:  ( %) und D:  ( %). In allen Gruppen lag die Verschreibung einer Positivdruck-Therapie (PAP) bei - %. Die Compliance betrug bei Therapiekontrolle im Median , h/Tag. Die Einteilung nach AHI zeigte sowohl unbehandelte Patienten trotz Symptomen/Komorbiditäten, als auch behandelte Patienten trotz Fehlens von Symptomen/Komorbiditäten (. Abb. b). Die Relevanz der Baveno-Einteilung spiegelt sich im Therapieerfolg wider: Der Blutdruck zeigte sich in den Gruppen mit Komorbidität (C und D), der ESS in den symptomatischen Gruppen B und D signifikant gebessert (. Abb. a, b). Schlussfolgerungen: Die Klassifikation nach Baveno erlaubt tatsächlich die unmittelbare Identifikation jener Patienten, die prognostisch und/oder symptomatisch von einer Therapie profitieren. Da alle Bavenogruppen in den verschiedenen AHI-Schweregraden mit relevantem Anteil vertreten sind zeigt sie umgekehrt aber auch, dass eine Therapiesteuerung alleinig orientiert am AHI jene Patienten mit milder Schlafapnoe der Gruppen B, C, D unbehandelt ließe, die das Potenzial einer symptomatischen und/ oder prognostischen Besserung aufweisen. Die Bavenoklassifikation erlaubt weit besser als der AHI verschiedene OSA-Phänotypen abzubilden und das therapeutische Procedere festzulegen.

Ergebnisse:  % bzw. , % der Teilnehmer gaben an, seit COVID- schlechter bzw. kürzer zu schlafen,  % bzw. , % gaben an besser bzw. länger zu schlafen. Berufstätige im Home-Office weisen einen variableren AB auf (r = ,**) und schlafen im Vergleich zur Zeit vor COVID- länger (-,**). Ein variabler AB ist mit einer schlechteren SQ (r = -,*) verbunden, hat aber keinen Einfluss auf die SD. Die SQ weist zudem Zusammenhänge mit Arbeitsstress (r = -,**), NA (r = -,**) und PA (r = ,**) auf, die SD lediglich einen Zusammenhang mit Arbeitsstress (r = -,**). Es zeigt sich weiter, dass eine höhere SQ mit einer längeren SD einhergeht (r = ,**). Bei der linearen Regression zur Vorhersage der SD durch Arbeitsstress und SQ erwies sich nur die SQ als signifikanter Prädiktor (. Abb. ). Die Ergebnisse der linearen Regression zur Vorhersage der SQ durch PA, NA, Arbeitsstress, variabler AB und SD zeigen, dass alle Prädiktoren, außer der Variable AB, einen signifikanten Einfluss auf die SQ aufweisen (. Abb. ). Schlussfolgerungen: Unsere Daten zeigen, dass die \"Baveno\"-Klassifikation tatsächlich in der Lage ist, vier verschiedene Phänotypen mit relevanter Häufigkeit in einer repräsentativen europäischen Patientenkohorte abzugrenzen. Unterschiede in der T, die bekanntermaßen mit schlechten kognitiven, kardiovaskulären und metabolischen Ergebnissen korreliert, lässt ein unterschiedliches Outcome der Bavenogruppen vermuten. Dies sollte in einer prospektiven Multicenter-Studie überprüft werden. Objectives: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has a high prevalence in the Swiss population (. % in men and . % in women) []. The currently used diagnostics with multichannel sleep studies is often cumbersome and more unobtrusive methods to diagnose SDB are desirable. Single-lead ECG has been investigated for the detection of SDB [, ]. With the emergence of optical heart rate monitoring (PPG) via wrist-worn devices, we investigated whether ECG-based algorithms could be translated to PPG signals for the detection of SDB. Methods: For the detection of SDB events, we used machine learning algorithms via heart rate variability (HRV). Initially, various algorithms were trained and tested on ECG-derived HRV from  subjects ( without SDB,  mild,  moderate,  severe SDB) from a public dataset of the MESA study []. Thereafter, the best performing algorithm was evaluated on  subjects ( without SDB,  mild,  moderate,  severe SDB) from a clinical study (NCT) at the Inselspital (Bern, Switzerland). Finally, we used the same algorithm to detect SDB events via HRV obtained from a wrist-worn PPG device from the same subjects. Results: On the first dataset (MESA) we obtained the following performance using ECG-derived HRV for the detection of SDB events: accuracy  %, sensitivity  %, specificity  %, and precision  %. On the second dataset (Inselspital) we obtained: accuracy  %, sensitivity  %, specificity  %, and precision  %. Using PPG-derived HRV from the second dataset resulted in: accuracy of  %, sensitivity  %, specificity  %, and precision  %. Conclusions: Compared to previous studies [, ], our algorithm was trained on a much larger dataset while the resulting performance remains comparable to both ECG-[] and PPG-based studies []. Therefore, we conclude that HRV features alone are not sufficient to reliably detect SDB events. Future work will focus on adding features related to oxygen saturation [] and PPG-derived respiration [] to improve SDB diagnostics using a wrist-worn device. Fragestellung: Koffein wird häufig verwendet, um die negativen Wirkungen von Schlafmangel auf die kognitive Leistung zu mildern. Da es bislang wenig wissenschaftliche Erkenntnis zur Frage gibt, für wie lange Koffein die kognitive Leistung bei chronischem Schlafmangel aufrechterhalten kann, untersuchten wir die Wirksamkeit von handelsüblichem Kaffee bei Personen mit genetisch-bedingt hoher Koffein-Sensitivität. Patienten und Methoden: Im Schlaflabor wurden  gesunde Probanden (Alter - Jahre) untersucht. Das sequentielle Design begann mit einer Adaptations-und zwei Basisnächten mit je -stündiger Bettzeit (TIB), an die sich  weitere Tage anschlossen, die in  Gruppen variiert wurden. Die Kontrollgruppe (n = ,  Frauen (F)) hatte immer  h TIB. Die Restriktionsgruppe (n = ,  F) verbrachte  Nächte mit  h TIB (experimentelle Studientage E-E), denen eine Erholungsnacht (Studientag Rec) mit  h TIB folgte. Die Koffeingruppe (n = ,  F) hatte dieselben Schlafzeiten wie die Restriktionsgruppe, erhielt aber standardisiert  g Kaffee (∼ mg Koffein) pro Tag während E-E und  g Kaffee (∼ mg Koffein) an E. Die entkoffeinierte Gruppe (n = ,  F) durchlief dasselbe Design wie die Koffeingruppe, erhielt jedoch entkoffeinierten Kaffee. Für die beiden Kaffee-Gruppen wurden Träger des C/ C-Allels des Adenosin-AA-Rezeptors (ADORA c.) selektiert. Ergebnisse: Die Gruppen wurden mittels einer gemischten ANOVA mit Bonferroni-Korrektur (α < ,) hinsichtlich ihrer Verschlechterung in der Tagesleistung (Differenzen zum . Basistag in der Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit (/Reaktionszeit) zum Zeitpunkt , ,  und  h wach) in einem -minütigen Psychomotorischen Vigilanztest verglichen. Die Restriktionsgruppe war langsamer als die Kontrollgruppe von E-E (p < ,), aber nicht während Rec (p = ,). Die Koffeingruppe war schneller als die entkoffeinierte Gruppe an E (p = ,) und auch schneller als die Restriktionsgruppe während E und E (p < ,). Von E bis Rec war die Koffeingruppe jedoch langsamer als die Kontrollgruppe (p < ,). Die entkoffeinierte Gruppe reagierte schneller als die Restriktionsgruppe zum Zeitpunkt  h wach an E und E. Sie war jedoch langsamer als die Kontrollgruppe von E-E (p < ,), aber nicht während Rec (p = ,). Schlussfolgerungen: Bei Koffein-sensitiven Personen vermochten ∼ mg Koffein die kognitive Leistung für zwei Tage auf einem ausgeschlafenen Niveau zu halten, führten jedoch zu einer verzögerten Erholung.

            " Methods: A protocol was prepared according to meta-analyses guidelines. Study selection was all RCTs conducted in adult narcoleptic patients (ANP) assessing at least one of the  treatments and placebo. Univariate meta-analyses were performed separately for ESS, MWT and CAR, and confirmed by a multivariate comparison based on an agregating Z-score. Safety index was the Adverse Events incidence (AEI). Finally, a Risk/Efficacy index was calculated as a summary mean of Efficacy and Safety Zscore. A NMA was needed due to the multiple treatment comparison and multi-arm studies needing correction on correlation matrix. The random model was assumed due to the expected between studies heterogeneity. Results: In ANP, Modafinil/Armodafinil (MDF), sodium oxybate (SXB) and Pitolisant (P), demonstrated their efficacy to reduce EDS; P and SXB demonstrated their efficacy to reduce CAR.  studies were included in the NMA,  treatments groups were considered: MDF - mg/ d, SXB  g/d (SXB) and  g/d (SXB) and P up to  mg/d (P) and up to  mg/d (P), and placebo. Placebo was considered as the reference value. SXB, MDF and P were significantly different from placebo for ESS, MWT and CAR. In the ranking of treatments performed according to P-scores (Equivalent Sucra Values) and for all the efficacy endpoints confirmed by the multivariate meta-analysis, the highest treatment effect was found for P, followed by SXB and MDF. The best safety profile compared with placebo was for Pitolisant (all doses), followed by Modafinil. SXB was characterized by a higher AEI. Finally, the best Risk/Benefit index was observed with P.\n",

            "The COVID- pandemic has highlighted the risks that can be involved in healthcare work. In this paper, we explore the issue of staff safety in clinical work using the example of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the COVID- crisis. We articulate some of the specific ethical challenges around PPE currently being faced by front-line clinicians, and develop an approach to staff safety that involves balancing duty to care and personal well-being. We describe each of these values, and present a decision-making framework that integrates the two. The aim of the framework is to guide the process of balancing these two values when staff safety is at stake, by facilitating ethical reflection and/or decision-making that is systematic, specific and transparent. It provides a structure for individual reflection, collaborative staff discussion, and decision-making by those responsible for teams, departments and other groups of healthcare staff. Overall the framework guides the decision maker to characterise the degree of risk to staff, articulate feasible options for staff protection in that specific setting and identify the option that ensures any decrease in patient care is proportionate to the increase in staff well-being. It applies specifically to issues of PPE in COVID-, and also has potential to assist decision makers in other situations involving protection of healthcare staff. \n",

The paper is divided into eight sections: () It is specified what challenges a non-foundationalist justification and normativity has to meet. () A three-dimensional conception of responsibility is developed based on the human triangular I-We-World relations. () The concepts of bounded responsibility and bounded ethics of science and technology are formulated. () The principle of reflective equilibrium is introduced as a principle of rationality, and it is shown how this principle generates rational and reasonable justifications in the ethics of science and technology. () Against this background, a reconception of internal and external responsibilities of science is given. () The type of responsibility demanded is exemplified by today's climate research. () The paper argues for a hand-in-hand model of uncertainties in the sciences and for ethical obligations to preserve the conditions of human life on earth. The ethical argument is spelled out in terms of ethical care, preservation, and precaution.

We explore how, in principle, ICR can come about and what conditions might be effective in promoting more ethical behaviour. We propose a framework to understand attempts to develop more responsible behaviour at an industry level through processes of negotiation and coalition building. We suggest that any attempt to meaningfully influence ICR would require stakeholders to possess both power and legitimacy; moreover, magnitude and urgency of the issue at stake may affect the ability to influence ICR. The framework is applied to the retail banking industry, focusing on post-crisis experiences in two countries-Spain and the UK-where there has been considerable pressure on the retail banking industry by civil society and/or government to change behaviours, especially to abandon unethical practices. We illustrate in this paper how corporate responsibility at the sector level in retail banking is the product of context-specific processes of negotiation between civil society and public authorities, on behalf of customers and other stakeholders, drawing on legal and other institutions to influence industry behaviour.\n",

Typically, ecological communities serve as a reference point for sustainable lifestyles as they have strong environmental self-identity and values and are more likely to further engage in pro-environmental and energy-saving actions. Yet, it is unknown if individuals within these communities will act as expected, especially when confronted with extreme climatic challenges like heatwaves. It is also unclear which factors will define individual responses to these challenges. Utilising environmental self-identity and Value-Belief-Norm theories, this paper examines factors underlying cooling consumption behaviours of households living in a Universal Community with strong environmental world views in India. Twenty in-depth qualitative interviews with residents, thematically analysed, found that while people expressed strong environmental self-identity, preferences for air conditioner use was often mediated by hedonic factors such as comfort and sleep. Moral norms played a positive role in how people operated their air conditioners. Yet, when faced with the choice of using energy-efficient air conditioners, biospheric concern was of limited importance while situational factors like cost and functionality were more pivotal. The above results raise interesting questions around the difficulties that might emerge in changing preferences around air conditioning behaviours in non-environmental communities, especially, if environmentally conscious communities which are expected to be \"the locus of change for energy efficiency actions\" are significantly influenced by hedonic values.', \"initiative to aid development of science-based services to support safe, healthy, resilient and climate friendly cities.

The reviewed  articles contain evidence of absolute impact decoupling, especially between CO (and SOX) emissions and evidence on geographically limited (national level) cases of absolute decoupling of land and blue water use from GDP, but not of economy-wide resource decoupling, neither on national nor international scales. Evidence of the needed absolute global fast-enough decoupling is missing.', 'publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re-use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source.

PURPOSE  Running head: PURPOSE Purpose by Design or Disaster: Preserving a Sense of Purpose amid Environmental Uncertainty PURPOSE \\n Psychological research suggests a sense of purpose in life is a coveted asset, with wellestablished linkages to well-being and healthy functioning. But how do individuals preserve this sense when previously reliable settings -and the opportunities they afford -are profoundly disrupted? The current moment provides a formidable test of this question, as widespread transmission of Covid- and intense efforts to slow it drastically transform our environment.', 'One of the strategies to reduce the environmental impacts associated with electricity is to employ renewable resources such as biomass or even waste.

Global stability is examined using the geometric approach which involves the generalization of Poincare-Bendixson criterion for systems of n-ordinary differential equations. Analytical results show that for a Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) model incorporating exogenous reinfection and primary progression infection mechanisms, an additional condition is required to fulfill the Bendixson criterion for global stability. That is, the model is globally asymptotically stable whenever a parameter accounting for exogenous reinfection is less than the ratio of background mortality to effective contact rate. Numerical simulations are also presented to support theoretical findings.']\n",

However, to date, the underlying mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of PM remain unclear. Our objective was to explore how exposure to relatively low doses of urban air PM alters innate responses to bacterial and viral stimuli in vitro. We used secondary alveolar epithelial cell line along with monocyte-derived macrophages to replicate innate lung barrier in vitro. Co-cultured cells were first exposed for  hours to PM .- (particle aerodynamic diameter between  and .µm) and subsequently for an additional  hours to lipopolysaccharide (TLR), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (TLR), and synthetic single-stranded RNA oligoribonucleotides (TLR/) to mimic bacterial or viral stimulation. Toxicological endpoints included pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-, IL-, and TNF-α), cellular metabolic activity, and cell cycle phase distribution. We show that cells exposed to PM .- produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation with bacterial TLR ligand than cells exposed to PM .- or bacterial ligand alone.\\n On the contrary, PM .- exposure reduced pro-inflammatory responses to viral ligands TLR and TLR/. Cell cycle analysis indicated that viral ligands induced cell cycle arrest at the G-M phase. In PM-primed co-cultures, however, they failed to induce the G-M phase arrest.\\n Contrarily, bacterial stimulation caused a slight increase in cells in the sub-G phase but in PM .- primed co-cultures the effect of bacterial stimulation was masked by PM .-. These findings indicate that PM .- may alter responses of immune defense differently against bacterial and viral infections. Further studies are required to explain the mechanism of immune modulation caused by PM in altering the susceptibility to respiratory infections. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights • Exposure to ambient PM increases susceptibility to respiratory infections.\\n • Fine PM increased inflammatory response against bacterial stimulation in vitro.\\n • Inflammatory response against viral stimulation was suppressed in PM treated cells.\\n • Fine PM also altered the capacity of viral ligand to induce G-M cell-cycle arrest.\\n J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f', 'One of the strategies to reduce the environmental impacts associated with electricity is to employ renewable resources such as biomass or even waste.

We consider a generalized compartmental model that represents the form of the most popular epidemiological models and we design safety-critical controllers that formally guarantee safe evolution with respect to keeping certain populations of interest under prescribed safe limits. Furthermore, we discuss how measurement delays originated from incubation period and testing delays affect safety and how delays can be compensated via predictor feedback. We demonstrate our results by synthesizing active intervention policies that bound the number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths for epidemiological models capturing the spread of COVID- in the USA.', 'This paper summarizes some of the ways in which increased use of renewable energy can reduce vulnerability of nations and communities to hydro-meteorological disasters (i.e. enhance their resilience). It uses examples mainly from the small island countries of the Pacific, as the issues raised are particularly pertinent there. In particular, distributed electricity generation reduces vulnerability of supply to severe weather.', 'As the world continues to deal with climate-induced heat events, sustainable energy behaviours, or lifestyles combined with non-behavioural interventions have been identified as crucial pathways to curb the demand for air conditioners. Typically, ecological communities serve as a reference point for sustainable lifestyles as they have strong environmental self-identity and values and are more likely to further engage in pro-environmental and energy-saving actions. Yet, it is unknown if individuals within these communities will act as expected, especially when confronted with extreme climatic challenges like heatwaves. It is also unclear which factors will define individual responses to these challenges. Utilising environmental self-identity and Value-Belief-Norm theories, this paper examines factors underlying cooling consumption behaviours of households living in a Universal Community with strong environmental world views in India. Twenty in-depth qualitative interviews with residents, thematically analysed, found that while people expressed strong environmental self-identity, preferences for air conditioner use was often mediated by hedonic factors such as comfort and sleep. Moral norms played a positive role in how people operated their air conditioners. Yet, when faced with the choice of using energy-efficient air conditioners, biospheric concern was of limited importance while situational factors like cost and functionality were more pivotal. The above results raise interesting questions around the difficulties that might emerge in changing preferences around air conditioning behaviours in non-environmental communities, especially, if environmentally conscious communities which are expected to be \"the locus of change for energy efficiency actions\" are significantly influenced by hedonic values.']\n"
